replace the code in the query with that and run it again;

10. Now make sure your local database instance is running and check the password you have for it;

11. Go back to visual studio code, or other and open .env  (its in ./Correctly_structured_project folder)
find where it says password: "root", and change "root" to your instance password
leave empty if you dont have a paswword for it;

12. Then open a terminal in visual studio code, write 'cd ./correctly_structured_project/src' and then 'node app.js'
