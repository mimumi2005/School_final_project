How to run the project:
- 
```
1. Download all the neccesary technoligies:
    1. MySQL 8.0 database;
    2. Visual studio code or other IDE;
    3. Node.js
    (Might need to run Powershell as admin and run "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned")
```
```
2. Download the repository as zip;

3. Uzip the folder;

4. Run the folder with visual studio code or other IDE;

```
That finishes the frontend setup, now you need to set up the database.
```
5. To start with the database, run MySQL workbench;

6. Run your local instance of MySQL and check the username and password you have for it;

7. Create a database scheme named "carrepairshop", or change the .env database name to an exsisting one;

8. Go back to visual studio code, or other and open .env  (its in ./Correctly_structured_project folder)
find where it says password: "root", and change "root" to your instance password
leave empty if you dont have a paswword for it;

9. Open terminal in the IDE and run the command "npx knex migrate:latest --knexfile ./knexfile.cjs" and then "npx knex seed:run --knexfile ./knexfile.cjs" to generate the database data;
12. Then open a terminal in visual studio code, write 'cd ./correctly_structured_project/src' and then 'node app.js'
````
Now go back to the web page and the database should be up and running at localhost.
